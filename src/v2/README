Installation instructions for ET

All needed files should be copied from floppy disk to directory choosed
for installation (eg. C:\et for Windows or /usr/local/et for Unix).

1. Quick Windows installation.
------------------------------
For installation of binary version of ET on Microsoft Windows run file
etwin.exe which is self-extracting archive.

Run command et to start ET system.

2. Quick Linux installation.
----------------------------
For installation of binary version of ET on Linux extract compressed tar
file etlin.tgz using command 
%tar xzf etlin.tgz

Run command et to start ET system.

(File run.x86-linux is dynamically linked with libc5. If you have system
 with glibc you should use file run.x86-linux from sml distribution, or 
 install needed libraries).

3. Compilation from sources.
----------------------------
Unpack sources using command
%tar xf etsrc.tar

If you have installed sml with Compilation Manager (sml-cm) run command
%sml-cm
and (in sml) start compilation by
- CM.make();
then use
- use "etMake.sml";
to generate heap with compiled version of ET (et.name_of_your_system).

If don't have sml with Compilation Manager run command
%sml
and compile ET by
- use "et.sml"; use "etMake.sml";

You should find file run.name_of_your_system in sml installation.
To run ET you have to run this file with argument
@SMLload=et.name_of_your_system.

These are examples:
- for Linux:
./run.x86-linux @SMLload=et.x86-linux

- for Windows:
run.x86-win32.exe @SMLload=et.x86-win32
