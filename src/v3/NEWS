version 2.0.5, Nov 5 2004
  - fixed some nasty bugs with let-polymorphism, reported by Tomasz
    Wegrzynowski
  - we can now handle multiple arguments in codatatypes without the help of
    the UNION type
  
version 2.0.4, Oct 19 2004
  - more documentation -- IPL manual along with a mental patch has been
    included
  - GNU Make for Windows binary has been included
  - FALSE datatype has been renamed to BOTTOM (in startup.et)
  - there are now a few aliases for startup.et types and values, used
    also during pretty printing the result:
      {}    = BOTTOM
      case0 = _BOTTOMit
      case1 = _UNITit
      when  = _UNIONit
      ()    = Unit
    The Pair and _BOOLit shortcuts (, and if-then-else) are now also used
    in pretty printing. 
    snd and fst are used instead of _UNIONit. It is only relevant to pretty
    printing, so don't be confused by the eta long form of + fst;.

  - added UNIT to startup.et

version 2.0.1, Mar 13 2003

    you need to recall something from interactive session.
